1.Data Persistence: Docker volumes allow you to store your application data separately from the container, which ensures data persistence even if the container is deleted or recreated. This means you can maintain your data even if you stop or delete your container.
Data Sharing: Docker volumes allow you to share data between containers, making it easier to manage data across multiple containers.
Data Backup and Recovery: With Docker volumes, you can easily backup and restore your data, which is crucial in case of data loss or disaster recovery.
Better Performance: Docker volumes can improve the performance of your application by reducing the I/O overhead associated with storing and retrieving data from the container's file system.
Scalability: With Docker volumes, you can scale your application by adding or removing containers without affecting the data stored in the volumes.
Easy Configuration: Docker volumes allow you to configure your application data separately from the container configuration, making it easier to manage your application's data.
